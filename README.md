# freeDV_notifier
a client-based script to receive a push notification when there is activity on the freeDV QSO finder - quick and dirty

1. create an account on pushover.net, register a device and create an API key
2. update the script with your pushover credentials (user name and application API key)
3. load it in your browser and wait. You should receive a notification when a new comment is posted in free 

Only use locally. *Do not* put it on a server as it contains your credentials

TODO: add filters (eg: do not receive disconnect events)
